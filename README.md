# Program to determine whether an email is spam or not (with around 87% accuracy), which utilized a K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm I implemented from scratch.

This program predicts if an email is spam or not. Although the K-Nearest-Neighbor classifier can be easily called from preexisting libraries, in my Data Mining course, I took on the challenge of coding it myself from scratch. For this project, after preprocessing my dataset, I calculated the ‘distance’ between each email in the test set and each email in the training set and used this to make a model to predict whether or not a new email was spam to around 87% accuracy.
